# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1:

# Objective
**Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of
ages or genders in a population.**

# Tools and Libraries used
-  Jupyter notebook
-  Pandas
-  Numpy
-  Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project explores global population data through data visualization techniques. Using Python, the notebook demonstrates how to analyze and present population statistics across countries using histograms and bar charts:

Histogram â†’ Shows the distribution of population (continuous variable) for the Top 15 most populated countries in a selected year.

Bar Chart â†’ Displays the Top 10 most populated countries, with country names (categorical variable) on the x-axis and population values on the y-axis.
